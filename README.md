# Stock Price Prediction
This project aims to forecast stock prices using historical data, implementing time-series analysis and machine-learning models. The goal is to analyze market trends and provide actionable insights for investors.

Features of the Dataset Date: Trading date. Open: The opening price of the stock. Close: The closing price of the stock. High: Highest price during the trading day. Low: Lowest price during the trading day. Volume: Number of shares traded. Workflow

Exploratory Data Analysis: Time-series analysis to identify trends and seasonality. Visualization of historical stock price patterns.

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values and outliers. Feature scaling for improved model performance.

Model Development: ARIMA for time-series forecasting. LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks for deep learning-based predictions. Evaluation using metrics like RMSE and MAPE.

Results: Comparison of traditional and deep learning approaches to stock price forecasting.
